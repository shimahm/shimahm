## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a PhD student with a research focus on **genomics and bioinformatics**, particularly in oilseed crops of the *Brassica* genus. My work involves analyzing high-throughput **DNA sequencing data** to understand how **copy number variation (CNVs)** influence **oil profile traits** in various *Brassica* species.

ðŸ”¬ **Current Projects**  
- Investigating the **effect of CNV on oil composition** in *Brassica* species using genome-wide sequencing and statistical modeling.  
- Analyzing **genomic variation in *Brassica carinata*** to identify key loci contributing to oil profile diversity and potential for crop improvement.

ðŸ§¬ I am passionate about integrating genomics, computational biology, and plant breeding to support sustainable agriculture and crop development.

ðŸ“« Feel free to connect or collaborateâ€”always happy to learn and share ideas!
