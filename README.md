## Hi there 👋
### 👩‍💻 About Me
PhD researcher in **bioinformatics and genomics** with a focus on multi-omics analysis and reproducible pipelines. My work involves analyzing large-scale sequencing data **(RNA-seq, GWAS, CNV, long-read assemblies)** to uncover genomic variation and link it to important crop traits.

🔬 **Current Projects**
- Developing reproducible workflows (Nextflow, Snakemake) for omics data analysis on HPC (SLURM).
- Investigating genomic variation in *Brassica* species to understand the genetic architecture of oil composition and seed traits.
- Applying comparative genomics to uncover structural variation and gene regulation.

🧬 Passionate about integrating genomics, computational biology, and data science to deliver actionable insights for plant breeding, biotechnology, and healthcare.

📫 Always open to collaboration and knowledge sharing—let’s connect!
